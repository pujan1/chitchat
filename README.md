Agular CLI



## Features

Simple chat echo bot app which can be started by login in with your name. 

After login you can send a message and the chat bot will send back the same message from its api. 



## TechnicalDescription

This is a simple demo project that was used to build the chat bot app. 

It can be even easily implemented with a single component itself. But I have Tried to make it a bit more complex to demonstrate all the Angular Technologies Used. 

Used http services to make a post request to the bot. 
Created a custom directive for the background color of the date for demonstration. 
organised controllers modules services and directives in their respective folders.
Used SASS as pre processor for CSS.
